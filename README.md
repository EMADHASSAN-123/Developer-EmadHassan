 website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my profile as a web developer, highlighting my skills and services, and interactively showcasing my past projects. The design uses Arabic fonts and Font Awesome icons, and is fully responsive across all devices. It has an organized interface that includes "About Me," "Works," "Services," and "Contact" sections. Technologies such as Bootstrap were also used within the skills, with project presentations supported by pop-up windows to display details and live links.
